# jvm

- kotlin runs on the JVM, but can also be compiled to JS and there's also "Kotlin/Native" (think native apps)
- kotlin code is directly compiled to java bytecode, not first to java source code
- IntelliJ has a built-in Java to kotlin converter
  - call action `convert Java to Kotlin` on a .java file
  - convert content from clipboard
